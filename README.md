# Crab Game - 1hAck Source Code

1hAck is the biggest Crab Game Mod Menu with over 60 features and the capability of making scripts for it in LUA (a programming language). I decided to make the menu open-source for other developers to learn about game hacking, specifically Unity Game hacking. You can improve/extend the menu yourself and share it with friends, you also don't need to give me credit for it, but you are **NOT ALLOWED TO SELL** the menu in any way. You can see how to build the project in `main.cpp`, I used the *kiero-imgui-hook* project template which requires the *DirectX SDK*, so if you want to actually be able to compile, you will need to download the SDK.

Be aware that this project is **very poorly written, violating many programming guidelines and principals.** I started this project very long ago with no big prior experience of programming.
